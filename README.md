## 🧠 Overview  
**Day 05** of my #100Days100Projects challenge — where repetition becomes a superpower!  
Today’s focus was on mastering **loops** in Python: `for`, `while`, and using `time.sleep()` to bring **timing control** into play.

With these concepts, I built an interactive **Countdown Timer** that simulates real-time delays — perfect for a variety of use cases like timers, clocks, or event countdowns!

## 🎯 Today’s Project Spotlight: Countdown Timer ⏰

A dynamic countdown timer script built using Python’s looping and delay tools.  
It counts down from a user-defined number and prints each second with a 1-second pause.

🔧 Features:
- Accepts user input for countdown duration  
- Uses `while` loop for countdown logic  
- Utilizes `time.sleep(1)` for real-time effect  
- Displays live updates in terminal

💡 A perfect starting point for future alarm clocks, stopwatches, or timed apps.
